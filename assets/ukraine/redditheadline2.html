			Anton Gerashchenko: Kateryna "Birdie" Polishchuk from Azovstal is alive! Russians filmed a video with her. She is a POW. They call her a sniper although she is a paramedic. Kateryna says she's sorry only that her mom heard her swearing in one of the videos. Most importantly - she's alive.<br></br><center>Score: 1040</center><br></br><center><i font-size:80%;>Url: https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1571536608180011008</i></center>
