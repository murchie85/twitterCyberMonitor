			So I was referenced for a Azure positon with learning about working and building firewalls on the side back in December. Was offered the position yesterday. But haven't been in my current position for a year which is a help desk call center job. I wanna take the position, is it the right decision?<br></br><center>Score: 0</center><br></br><center><i font-size:80%;>Url: https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/rz65w5/so_i_was_referenced_for_a_azure_positon_with/</i></center>
